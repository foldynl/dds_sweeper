This project implements an antenna analyzer based on DDS A9850 and Arduino Nano. It was forked from an original project by DK2JK (http://dk2jk.darc.de/arduino/antennenanalyser/prototyp_m4/).

The new features:

 - source code cleanup
 - new calibration support
 - removed CW module
 - new Java client
 - etc.
